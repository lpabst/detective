# Detective

Simple canvas game that I'll probably never finish. You can play as a detective or as an outlaw. The outlaw tries to evade the detective for a specified number of rounds, and the detective tries to get close enough to 'apprehend' the outlaw. Each player would not be able to see the other's location, although the quadrant the opponent is in should light up to indicate the opponent is there. The detective gets a certain number of APBs that reveal the exact location of the outlaw (2 or 3 maybe) that can help with getting close to the outlaw. Before each round starts the player can spend a few points upgrading their character in different ways to make each matchup unique or at least not the exact same. Points could be spent to upgrade character movespeed per round, or to buy more APBs for the detective, etc.
